Prepared a basic game which we played when the internet is off with the help of OpenCV detecting hand gesture

To run the program first install all the libraries from requirments.txt 

it will then open the capture window to map the hand cordination allocation 

How to play

if the distance between your index and thumb decreases i.e closed the DINO will jump reacting to that

Imagine having a gun as your finger and shoot to jump
